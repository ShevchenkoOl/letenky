# Letenky
This project was written using React, a separate ```flightData.json``` was taken as the backend, and I took a public backend to register the users. The project used the SASS method and BEM methodology, and libraries. The [axios](https://axios-http.com/) library is used for HTTP requests. The async/await syntax is used. The [notiflix](https://github.com/notiflix/Notiflix#readme) library is used for notifications.
